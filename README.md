# Game_Of_Life


Very simple project implementing conway game of life in unity using an object grid.

The system gets updated every cycle. On the end of each cycle a copy is stored in a list.
The new cycle updates the cells based on the stored data. Works with 2d and 3d grid patterns, however keep in mind 
that the workload is exponential when working in 3D.
